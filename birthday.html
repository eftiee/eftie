        <h1>Happy Birthday, Rem!</h1>
        <p>
            Hey baby, I wanted you to know that I love you sososo much and I'm sorry if I've ever done something to hurt you, I never meant it. I'm sorry for being annoying and clingy all the time, I'm sorry for being loud and chaotic on calls, I'm sorry for not giving you space and for so many stuff but I swear I'll try to be a better gf because guess what?? It's your BDAY which means that we are even closer to meeting each other!! I really want you to know that I'm so serious about this relationship and I would do anything for it to last. I would never leave someone like you because you're literally the sweetest boy and the best boyfriend ever and you deserve all the good things in the world and I'm willing to give them to you whether it is all my love or even small gifts, kisses, and hugs. You gave my life a meaning, literally you made me wanna keep going, you made me wanna have a future, and I can't explain the feeling I get whenever I speak to you. I love you. Happy birthday, my sweet and handsome boy! ❤️
        </p>
